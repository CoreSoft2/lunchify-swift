Lunchify (iOS)
===
This swift app shows a list of venues to have lunch at in Finland. Having a lunch buffet during lunch time in work-days is pretty common in Finland and many employees go to different venues during lunch.

## Supported Locations
- Helsinki City Centre
- Espoo (Keilaniemi, Leppävaara, ...)
- _More locations will be added gradually_

## Data
Venue and meal data is provided by most of the corporate vendors (Amica, Sodexo, etc). In case there is no vendor, the data is scraped off the restaurants’ websites.

## Install
``` bash
$ git clone git@github.com:sallar/lunchify-swift.git
$ cd lunchify-swift
$ carthage update
``` 
Then open the project in XCode and run in simulator or on your device.
